# Social-Email-Template
This is a repo for HTML templates for Social Support updates
This is a template that can be used as a base. However all of the links need to be changed in order for the images and the links to the content. All of the content in the current file is linked to locale files. 

To use the template: 
1. Copy the file
2. Edit the urls and file paths to images and urls to a valid public url
3.[This could be a different method depending on what you are using to send out the email template or what newsletter contact manager (ie mailchimp, sales cloud?) ] Copy the html into the chrome web extension - Insert HTML into Gmail 


Suggestions: 
change the colors and heading image to match your logo for your community or locale.
